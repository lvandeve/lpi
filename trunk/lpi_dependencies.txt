lpi units
---------

lodepng: PNG reading and writing. Also independent zlib encoder/decoder.
lodewav: wav file reading and writing
lpi_audio: playing audio, audio samples being std::vector<double>'s
lpi_base64: base64 encode/decode
lpi_bignums: contains currently a 128-bit fixed point number class
lpi_color: different color types and conversions
lpi_crypto: xtea implementation (not guaranteed to be safe, use at own risk)
lpi_draw2d: draw 2D shapes in 2D RGBA buffers, and general 2D drawing algorithms such as line clipping
lpi_draw2dgl: draw 2D shapes in OpenGL (circles and rectangles and such, but not textures since lpi_texture does that)
lpi_draw3dgl: draw 3D primitives that aren't standard in OpenGL, e.g. a 3D linesegment-circle, and some GL related 3D math
lpi_event: events, keyboard and mouse input with SDL
lpi_file: load and save files through simpler interface
lpi_gl: a few simple OpenGL wrapper functions
lpi_gui: an OpenGL based gui with buttons, windows, scrollbars, ...
lpi_gui_base: very general base classes for lpi GUI, it especially handles the mouse. No dependencies on anything in it.
lpi_gui_color: GUI controls for selecting and viewing colors, like a HSV circle, RGB sliders, etc...
lpi_gui_drawer: interface for GUI drawers (currently only lpi_gui_drawer_gl uses it)
lpi_gui_drawer_gl: used by lpi_gui to draw everything (using OpenGL)
lpi_gui_dynamic: a dynamic GUI page with controls that can be bound to values of specific or generic types.
lpi_gui_ex: extra/extended GUI widgets for lpi_gui, such as drawing canvas, grid, ...
lpi_gui_input_sdl: key, mouse and time input implemenation for lpi_gui_base
lpi_gui_text: text-input related GUI widgets for lpi_gui, such as input line, input box, console, ...
lpi_math: some mathematics useful for games (random, quadratic solve, ...) but not in <cmath> (and also a sort function because where else to put it...)
lpi_math2d: 2D vector math
lpi_math3d: 3D vector, matrix, transformation and camera math
lpi_math4d: 4D vector and matrix
lpi_parse: parsing utilities
lpi_pathfind: A* path finding, useful for some games
lpi_screen: set up the SDL + OpenGL screen
lpi_text: font and text drawing --> TODO: should split this up in the non-screen dependent stuff and the screen dependent stuff
lpi_texture: class for textures for use in OpenGL or SDL screen. They can be drawn in 2D on screen, or used in 3D to map on OpenGL vertices.
lpi_time: SDL_GetTicks and a class for handling time for physics and FPS counter in game
lpi_tools: tools for developing lpi itself more easily
lpi_unittest: unit testing ability
lpi_xml: XML parsing and generating
quickcg: full 2D graphics SDL wrapper library, independent from lpi


External dependencies of lpi
----------------------------

C++ standard library
SDL
OpenGL


lpi units that depend only on standard C++
------------------------------------------

These can be used as independent libraries or tools whenever needed individually.

*) lodepng
*) lodewav
*) lpi_base64
*) lpi_bignums
*) lpi_color
*) lpi_crypto
*) lpi_file
*) lpi_gui_base
*) lpi_math
*) lpi_math2d
*) lpi_parse
*) lpi_pathfind
*) lpi_unittest
*) lpi_xml


lpi units that depend on a few other lpi units but not on SDL or OpenGL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Still useful as independent library in combination with only a few other lpi units.

*) lpi_draw2d: lpi_color

*) lpi_math3d: lpi_math2d

*) lpi_math4d: lpi_math3d


lpi units that depend on SDL and/or OpenGL, but not on other lpi units
----------------------------------------------------------------------

*) lpi_audio: SDL

*) lpi_event: SDL

*) lpi_gl: OpenGL

*) lpi_time: SDL

*) quickcg: SDL


lpi units that depend on both other lpi units and OpenGL or SDL
---------------------------------------------------------------

lpi units with lots of dependencies on other lpi units and the external libraries.
Indirect dependencies aren't always mentioned here. That is, if A depends on B and B on C,
then it isn't always mentioned that A indirectly depends on C.

*) lpi_draw2dgl: OpenGL, lpi_color, lpi_gl, lpi_draw2d

*) lpi_draw3dgl: OpenGL, lpi_color, lpi_draw2d, lpi_math3d
