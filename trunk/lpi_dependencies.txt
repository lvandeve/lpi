lpi units
---------

lodepng: PNG reading and writing. Also independent zlib encoder/decoder.
lodewav: wav file reading and writing
lpi_audio: playing audio, audio samples being std::vector<double>'s
lpi_base64: base64 encode/decode
lpi_bignums: contains currently a 128-bit fixed point number class
lpi_color: different color types and conversions
lpi_draw2d: draw 2D shapes in 2D RGBA buffers, and general 2D drawing algorithms such as line clipping
lpi_draw2dgl: draw 2D shapes in OpenGL (circles and rectangles and such, but not textures since lpi_texture does that)
lpi_draw3dgl: draw 3D primitives that aren't standard in OpenGL, e.g. a 3D linesegment-circle, and some GL related 3D math
lpi_event: events, keyboard and mouse input with SDL
lpi_file: load and save files through simpler interface
lpi_general: a mix of things that didn't find an own file (yet), such as SDL time, math, ...
lpi_gl: a few simple OpenGL wrapper functions
lpi_gui: an OpenGL based gui with buttons, windows, scrollbars, ...
lpi_math2d: 2D vector math
lpi_math3d: 3D vector, matrix, transformation and camera math
lpi_math4d: 4D vector and matrix
lpi_pathfind: A* path finding, useful for some games
lpi_screen: set up the SDL + OpenGL screen
lpi_text: font and text drawing --> TODO: should split this up in the non-screen dependent stuff and the screen dependent stuff
lpi_texture: class for textures for use in OpenGL or SDL screen. They can be drawn in 2D on screen, or used in 3D to map on OpenGL vertices.
lpi_tools: tools for developing lpi itself more easily
lpi_unittest: unit testing ability
lpi_xml: XML parsing and generating

External dependencies of lpi
----------------------------

C++ standard library
SDL
OpenGL

lpi units that depend only on standard C++
------------------------------------------

These can be used as independent libraries whenever needed individually.

*) lodepng
*) lodewav
*) lpi_base64
*) lpi_bignums
*) lpi_color
*) lpi_crypto
*) lpi_file
*) lpi_math2d
*) lpi_pathfind
*) lpi_unittest
*) lpi_xml

lpi units that depend on other lpi units but not on SDL or OpenGL
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Still useful as independent library in combination with only a few other lpi units.

*) lpi_draw2d: lpi_color

*) lpi_math3d: lpi_math2d

*) lpi_math4d: lpi_math3d

lpi units that depend on SDL and/or OpenGL, but not on other lpi units
----------------------------------------------------------------------

*) lpi_audio: SDL

*) lpi_event: SDL

*) lpi_general: SDL

*) lpi_gl: OpenGL

lpi units that depend on both other lpi units and OpenGL or SDL
---------------------------------------------------------------

lpi units with lots of dependencies on other lpi units and the external libraries.
Indirect dependencies aren't always mentioned here. That is, if A depends on B and B on C,
then it isn't always mentioned that A indirectly depends on C.

*) lpi_draw2dgl: OpenGL, lpi_color, lpi_gl, lpi_draw2d

*) lpi_draw3dgl: OpenGL, lpi_color, lpi_draw2d, lpi_math3d

*) lpi_gui: OpenGL, lodepng, lpi_general, lpi_event, lpi_text, lpi_texture, lpi_gl, lpi_color, lpi_draw2dgl, lpi_xml, lpi_file, lpi_base64

*) lpi_screen: SDL, OpenGL, lpi_color

*) lpi_text: OpenGL, lodepng, lpi_texture, lpi_color

*) lpi_texture: OpenGL, lodepng, lpi_base64, lpi_gl, lpi_color
