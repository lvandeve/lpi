/*
FileDialog is for selecting one or more files. It can be used both as "save" dialog and
as "load" dialog. The dialog itself isn't what will overwrite or load the file, the dialog
is there just to get a filename that the user selects.

TODO's:
[X] if it's a save dialog, ask confirmation if file exists
[X] ensure getting and setting current folder works (for remembering folder to initially open)
[X] filtering by extension type (requires drop down list to choose from)
[X] sort files alphabetically
[ ] show and sort files by date, size, ... (requires extensions to IFileBrowse and using a table instead of a simple List)
[ ] show some links to default or bookmarked paths on the left (home folder of linux, my documents of windows, some remembered ones...)
[X] double click on filename same functionality as pressing OK
[ ] pressing enter after typing in file inputline same functionality as pressing OK
[ ] ensure that it works with multiple file choosing
[ ] add "create directory" button
[ ] BUG: when using modal file dialog, and dropdown list is over ok button, you click ok through the list
[ ] add some helpful text labels indicating what they are left of the "path", "file" and "extensionChooser"
[ ] let the close button do the same as the cancel button
[ ] also make a folder browsing dialog
[ ] in save dialog, add a "automatically add extension" checkbox. If true and you type filename without extension from the list, it adds the first extension from the chosen type to the filename.
